      <h1>CONTROLS</h1>
      <p>
        select the dice you wish to use and then click on the desired number box
      </p>
      <p>
        each player has the opportunity to score an additional score box by
        using the main players white dice, to do so simply click on the players
        card, select the white dice, and select the desied number box. You cna
        only do this once per turn
      </p>
      <h1>Object of the Game</h1>
      <p>
        Score the most points by crossing out as many numbers in the four
        color-rows as possible while avoiding penalty points.
      </p>
      <h1>Setup</h1>
      <p>Each player takes a score sheet and something to write with.</p>
      <p>
        Before playing it's important to understand the one basic rule of Qwixx,
        which is that numbers must be crossed out from left to right in each of
        the four color-rows.
      </p>
      <p>
        You do not have to begin with the number farthest to the left, but if
        you skip any numbers, they cannot be crossed out afterward.
      </p>
      <img src="img/rule_1.jpg" alt="scorecard" />
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> In the red row first the 5 and then the 7 were
        crossed out. Therefore, the red 2, 3, 4 and 6 may not be crossed out
        later in the game. In the yellow row only the 11 and the 12 may still be
        crossed out. In the green row you can only cross out numbers to the
        right of the 6. In the blue row you can only cross out right of the 10.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Put a small horizontal line through the numbers
        that you skipped, so that you don't cross them out later by accident.
      </p>
      <h1>Game Play</h1>
      <p>
        The first player to roll a 6 takes on the role of "active player". The
        active player rolls all six dice. The following two actions are now
        carried out in order, always one after the other:
      </p>
      <div class="flex-row">
        <p>
          1. The active player adds up the two white dice and announces out
          loud, the resulting sum. All players may then (but are not required
          to) cross out the number that the active player announced in any (but
          only one) of the color-rows.

          <strong>Example:</strong> Chris is the active player. The two white
          dice show a 4 and a 1. Chris announces, "five". Tony crosses out the
          yellow 5 on his score sheet. Caroline crosses out the red 5. Annie and
          Nora choose not to cross out a number.
        </p>
        <img src="img/dice_ex_1.jpg" alt="dice example" />
      </div>
      <div class="flex-row">
        <p>
          2. The active player (but not the others) may then (but is not
          required to) add one of the white dice together with any one of the
          colored dice and cross out the number corresponding to this sum in the
          color-row corresponding to the color of the chosen die.

          <strong>Example:</strong> Chris adds together the white 4 with the
          blue 6 and crosses out the 10 in the blue color-row.
        </p>
        <img src="img/dice_ex_2.jpg" alt="dice example" />
      </div>
      <h1>Penalties</h1>
      <div class="flex-row">
        <p>
          If, after the two actions, the active player doesn't cross out at
          least one number, he must cross out one of the penalty boxes. Each
          penalty box is worth -5 points at the end of the game. (The non-active
          players do not take a penalty if they choose not to cross out a
          number).
        </p>
        <img src="img/dice_penalty.jpg" alt="penalty example" />
      </div>
      <h1>End of a Round</h1>
      <p>
        Once all players are ready, the player to the left becomes the new
        active player and re-rolls all six dice. Then the two actions described
        on the left are carried out again, one after the other.
      </p>
      <h1>Locking a Row</h1>
      <p>
        If you wish to cross out the number at the extreme right end of a
        color-row (red 12, yellow 12, green 2, blue 2) you must have first
        crossed out at least five numbers in that row.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you cross out the number on the extreme right, then also cross off
        the lock symbol directly next to it. This indicates that the color-row
        is now locked for all players and numbers of this color cannot be
        crossed out in future rounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The die of the corresponding color is immediately removed from the game.
      </p>
      <img src="img/scoring.jpg" alt="scorecard example" />
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Alison crosses out the green 2 and after it,
        the lock symbol. The green die is removed from the game.
      </p>
      <p>Notes:</p>

      <p>
        If a row is locked during the first action, it is possible that other
        players may, at the same time, also cross out the number on the extreme
        right and lock the same color-row. These players must also have
        previously crossed out at least five numbers in that row.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cross on the lock counts toward the total number of crosses marked
        in that color-row.
      </p>

      <h1>End of the Game</h1>
      <p>
        The game ends immediately as soon as either someone has marked a cross
        in his fourth penalty box or as soon as two dice have been removed from
        the game (two color-rows have been locked).
      </p>
      <p>
        It may occur (during the first action) that a third row is locked
        simultaneously with the second row.
      </p>
      <h3>Scoring</h3>
      <p>
        Beneath the four color-rows is a table indicating how many points are
        awarded for how many crosses within each row (including any locks marked
        with a cross).
      </p>
      <p>
        Each crossed out penalty box scores five minus-points. Enter your points
        for the four color-rows and the minus-points for any penalties in the
        appropriate fields at the bottom of the scoresheet
      </p>
      <p>The player with the highest total score is the winner.</p>

        <strong>Example:</strong>Alison has 4 crosses in red, which gives her 10
        points; in yellow, she has 3 (=6 points); in green 8 (=36 points); and
        in blue 7 (= 28 points). For her two penalties she must subtract 10
        points. This means that Alison's total score is 70 points.
