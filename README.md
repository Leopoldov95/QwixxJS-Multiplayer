## General Info

This is a javascript project for the popular dice game "Qwixx". This is my second attempt at making this game using javaScript. My first version was successful, but only allowed for a single player to play the game. While everything worked and the game was playable, it is a game designed to be played for 2 to 4 players. As a result I remade the game to allow for 2 to 4 players to be able to play. I included rules in the app for new players. For more in depth rules, check out https://www.ultraboardgames.com/qwixx/game-rules.php
My goal was familiarize myself with important JavaScript concepts such as Classes, modules, the "this" keyword, and using the DOM.

## What I Learned
This was quite an ambitous project for me. I used javaScript features that I was uncomfortable with such as classes and import/export modules but I realized just how useful these features are. I also learned that it is important that it is not enough to get a project to work (as in my first version of this game), but to make something that is usable and engaging. While it may not have the most efficient algorithms, I am elated that I was able to get the game to fully work.
